<h1>Monopoly game with tests and coverage</h1>
At the "Informal School of IT" we were given the homework of doing a simulation of the classical game Monopoly. 
The biggest challenge was to implement the Prison functionality and the building of the Hotels. Mostly because at the time I had problems with calculating when the counting of the houses on a given square ended and when the hotel logic started.

<h3>Testing</h3>
The testing was done using unittest, unittest mock.
